# Sentiment Analysis and Engagement Prediction

- In today's interconnected world, global news travels faster than ever, engaging audiences across platforms. This project leverages a dataset featuring **social media interactions** and **news article content** from renowned news outlets, including **Al Jazeera**, **Reuters**, **BBC**, and **CNN**. These outlets provide a rich source of text data and metrics for analyzing social media trends and engagement.

- First, we will apply advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to perform **sentiment analysis** on the text of news articles. Through detailed visualizations, we aim to uncover patterns in sentiment and its relationship with engagement metrics. 

- Next, we focus on predicting **total engagement**—a combination of **likes**, **comments**, and **shares**—using a robust machine learning model. By exploring and interpreting this dataset, we aim to provide actionable insights into what drives social media interactions with global news.

- The dataset for this project is sourced from [Kaggle: Global News Engagement on Social Media](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/global-news-engagement-on-social-media/data).
